       The <u>GVM — Suriya — </u>HJ film is one of the best movies ever to be made in this genre focusing on multiple relationships and their effect on individuals.                     <br>

        The film gives the audience a lot to learn. It stresses the fact that no matter what happens, life has to go on. There are better things waiting for you. <mark>கையில் கெடச்சத தொலைஞ்சா இன்னும் ரொம்ப புடிச்சது கிடைக்கும்.                    <br></mark>

        The movie had the right mix of every emotion. Starting from the Father-Son relationship, Husband — Wife relationship and Lovers relationship, the director dealt in such a way that only he can deal with it.<br>

        The classy voiceovers, the English accent dialogues, proposals, and scene staging — <u>Agmark GVM.<br></u>

        The film had some of the classiest proposal scenes ever. I bet everyone would have imagined at least once in our life about Suriya — Meghana Train Journey scenes in our Train Travel (but all I get is senior citizens). Or even the Krishna — Malini proposal scene would come to your mind when you see someone you like.<br>
       
        A father sees himself as a best friend for his son, a mother’s affection towards her family, a man going to any extent for the love of his life <mark>(Inga Irukku da America)</mark>, the pain of the death of a girlfriend <mark>(Anjala macha ava)</mark>, the comeback from it, the long wait for a lady for her love to be accepted, an understanding wife makes this movie what it is.<br>

        One of the most pivotal characters of the film appears only for a short period of time but has a huge impact on the lead when he is going through a tough time.<br>

        Harris Jayaraj might have provided one of his best albums for this film. Every song is a lovely composition. You cannot choose a particular song as your favorite.<br>

        This movie will always be on my list of Top 10 movies which had a profound impact on me. The range of lessons the film gives the audience in each sub-part is immense<br>

        <u>Suriya — Krishnan — Malini — Meghna - Priya will forever remain in our hearts.<br></u>
